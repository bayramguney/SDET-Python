LIST
list=[1,2,3]
print[list[1])
Allow duplicates
Mutable
list[0]=1
[]
slicing can be done list[1:2]
use list if you have a collection of data that does not need random access
use list when u need a simple,iterable collection that is modified frequently

DICTIONARY
dict= ["tom":2,"jim":3]
print(dict["tom"]
duplicate keys not but values allowed
dict["tom"]=2
mutable
{}
slicing can not be done
use when u need a logical association between key value pair
use when u need fast lookup for your data based on a custom key

TUPLE
tup=("10,20,30" or tup=10.20.30
tup=("john","jim") or tup="john"."jim"
print(tup[0])
allow duplicates.faster than list
tup[0]   type error
immutable
()
slicing can be done
use when your data can not change
a tup can be used in combination with dictionary,for example a tuple might represent
a key,because it is immutable
